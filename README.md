# Torch MeanFlow üåä

*A clean PyTorch implementation of the paper ["Mean Flows for One-step Generative Modeling"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13447) by Geng et al, with on-the-fly FID evaluation.*

Our goal is to provide a straightforward and clean **PyTorch implementation** of Mean Flow models for CIFAR-10 and MNIST, such that researchers can conduct experiments with minimal costs.

A good way to start is to play with our [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dQR09kiFx4yvUO6ENvC5S1K16-oQ6DZc?usp=sharing). We will walk you through the details of mean flow and train a toy model on MNIST.

## Environment Setup

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate easy_meanflow

git clone https://github.com/pkulwj1994/easy_meanflow.git
cd easy_meanflow
```

## Preparing datasets

We prepared our dataset following the instructions in [StyleGAN](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3).

CIFAR10 dataset can be simply downloaded through
```
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/william94/useful_public_data/resolve/main/cifar10-32x32.zip
```

To calculate FID score, you will also need to compare the generated images against the same dataset that the model was originally trained with. To facilitate evaluation, use the exact reference statistics of [EDM](https://github.com/NVlabs/edm/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file), which can be found at: [https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/edm/fid-refs/](https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/edm/fid-refs/).


## Getting started
A good way to start is to play with our [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dQR09kiFx4yvUO6ENvC5S1K16-oQ6DZc?usp=sharing). We will walk you through the details of mean flow and train a toy model on MNIST.

After that, if you want to train a meanflow model on CIFAR10, simply run:

```
sh ./exps/MF00/train_script.sh
```
or directly run

```
export PYTORCH_ENABLE_FUNC_IMPL=1 && \
export PYTORCH_DDP_NO_REBUILD_BUCKETS=1 && \
export TORCH_NCCL_IB_TIMEOUT=23 && \
export NCCL_TIMEOUT=3600 && \
export SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS=local && \
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 train_mf.py \
    --detach_tgt=1 \
    --outdir=logs/mf/MF00 \
    --data=cifar10-32x32.zip \
    --cond=0 --arch=ddpmpp --lr 10e-4 --batch 8
```

FID score is computed on the fly.

## Calculating FID

We also provide scripts for computing Fr&eacute;chet inception distance (FID), simply run:
```
sh cal_fid.sh
```
