## Environment Setup

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate easy_meanflow
```

## Preparing datasets

We prepared our dataset following the instructions in [StyleGAN](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3).

CIFAR10 dataset can be downloaded through
```
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/william94/useful_public_data/resolve/main/cifar10-32x32.zip
```

To calculate FID score, you will also need to compare the generated images against the same dataset that the model was originally trained with. To facilitate evaluation, use the exact reference statistics of [EDM](https://github.com/NVlabs/edm/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file), which can be found at: [https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/edm/fid-refs/](https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/edm/fid-refs/).


## Getting started
A good way to start is to play with our [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dQR09kiFx4yvUO6ENvC5S1K16-oQ6DZc?usp=sharing). We will walk you through the details of mean flow and train a toy model on MNIST.

After that, if you want to train a meanflow model on CIFAR10, simply run:

```
sh ./exps/MF00/train_script.sh
```
FID score is computed on the fly.

## Calculating FID

We also provide scripts for computing Fr&eacute;chet inception distance (FID), simply run:
```
sh cal_fid.sh
```
